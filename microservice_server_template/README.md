## Main packages ##

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.api ###
Supposed to contain only immutable DTOs annotated with lombok's @Data.

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.server.json ###
JSON object mapper interface and implementations.

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.server.logging ###
Logging interface and implementation.

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.server.services ###
Service interface and implementations.

To implement a new service is sufficient to extend the class ch.ethz.sis.microservices.server.services.Service. This class extends the standard J2EE HttpServlet and is up to the implementer to decide to accept the different http methods.

This class just provides a convenience method getServiceConfig() to retrieve the configuration.

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.server.startup ###

### ch.ethz.sis.microservices.util ###
