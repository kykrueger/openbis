Problem: 

ERROR causing test failure: Test data folder missing

Solution:

ssh ci@bs-ci01.ethz.ch
cd ~/jenkins/workspace_dist/integration-tests/targets/
ln -s /local0/ci/jenkins/test-data/ test-data


Note: If this happening on stage-jenkins you have to do the following:

ssh stage-jenkins
cd ~/hudson/tests-16.05/integration-tests/targets/
ln -s ../../../test-data test-data


Problem:

ERROR in test_openbis_sync: No such file or directory: 'targets/sissource_private-token.txt'

Solution:
ssh ci@bs-ci01.ethz.ch
cp ~/jenkins/test-data/sissource_private-token.txt ~/jenkins/workspace_dist/integration-tests/targets/

If ~/jenkins/test-data/sissource_private-token.txt is undefined it can be created as follows:

1. Log in into sissource web site.
2. Open your settings (found in the upper right corner as a drop-down item)
3. Choose 'Access Tokens'
4. Enter 'OpenbisSync' for the field Name
5. Choose an expiration date
6. Tick the check box of 'api Access you API' (not sure whether this is really needed)
7. Store the generated token in the file ~/jenkins/test-data/sissource_private-token.txt
