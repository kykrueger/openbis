/**
 * A Subclass of the GXT BaseModelData that simplifies default behavior ignoring special characters
 * ('.', '[', ']').
 * <p>
 * As a result nested value support is turned off. NestedValues check for key strings with '.' in
 * then treat them as paths for traversing multiple HashMaps. We don't need this, and, in fact, it
 * causes problems for us, since we occasionally use '.' as part of a normal column name for a table
 * without intending the nested-value semantics; thus we turn it off.
 * <p>
 * Also handling of property maps with syntax p1[key1] is switched off to allow '[' and ']'
 * characters in normal column names.
