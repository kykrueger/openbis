 * Classes that implement this interface encapsulate mass uploading of tabular files to the

 * convention <code><i>&lt;orderSpecifier&gt;</i>=<i>&lt;tableName&gt;</i>.&lt;file type&gt;</code>.
 * Here the order specifier ensures that the dependency is right while the table name is the name of
 * the table to upload the data to. The file type has to be <code>csv</code> (Comma veparated
 * values) or <code>tsv</code> (TAB separated values).
